# Anemoia
*anemoia - n. nostalgia for a time you’ve never known*

Imagine stepping through the frame into a sepia-tinted haze, where you could 
sit on the side of the road and watch the locals passing by. Who lived and died 
before any of us arrived here, who sleep in some of the same houses we do, who 
look up at the same moon, who breathe the same air, feel the same blood in their 
veins—and live in a completely different world.
