# i'm a computer artist?

in elementary school i drew cubes on scrap paper. 
the first art book that i loved was the work of escher. 
i was fascinated by optical illusions and perspective 
at 7 years old i discovered microsoft paint- and drew more cubes. 
using the line tool- i could get more precise with my geometry. 
I also enjoyed using the spraypaint tool- which scattered tiny particles across the digital canvas. 

art is like a reflection
it reflects the time period when it was created
when the church was the dominant power- hymns and chants were were articulately crafted to invoke God. 
but as the dominant powers have shifted- so has art. 
when the dominant powers are no longer centralized to a single entity, I wonder what the art will look like.

today i'm making art in Blender. the more time i spend in virtual spaces, the more i see the world like an infinitely complex mesh. that's what renews my appreciation of beauty. it's the tiny patterns  that are all interwoven together like a fine mesh and it all comes together to create an explosively energetic thing
