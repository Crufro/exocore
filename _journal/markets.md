# markets

i love the stock market because it's much like nature

imagine if you could see the energy of life in motion
of culture and society
of industry and innovation
solutions and problems 
all represented as a graph

this is what has always excited me about the stock market. it's a complex blend of energy, industry, economy, psychology, sentiment, and emotion. 
and it's all just represented through an aggregation of numbers, charts, and lines. 
the lines sometimes match- and sometimes they don't. 
we're always trying to figure them out, but can't quite seem to do it.
people manipulate the lines, but everything corrects itself in due time.
ups and downs- it's the law of gravity.
what goes up comes down. 

there's a little something for everyone in the stock market
there's money to be claimed
