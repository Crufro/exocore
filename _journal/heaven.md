# what is heaven

in heaven you are neither here nor there. you are everywhere at once.
this is because when you are in heaven- you are as you feel 

i imagine it as a sorta spectral cloud and sporatically distributed points 

raw and pure energy- dissolved and particulate in nature

each particle (fragments of a spirit) interacting in a fluid way

continuing our mission towards endless expansion  

and you can navigate this etherscape conciously
weaving between gaps in quantum fabric

conjuring visuals instantly

you can pull from the akashic records just by thinking

and we'll be posting together in heaven like we do on the internet 

seamless communication. cosmology as a medium

and endlessly accelerating towards infinite potential
