# tfw it's all just compression & interpolation

When I first gained access to Open AI's DALLE. I was immediately enthralled and fascinated, but moments after using it, a strong feeling of despair washed over me. I'd wondered if it was all my energy was for nothing and teared up. It felt incredible to be on the verge of abundant creative opportunities, but daunting. In a flicker, my creative aspirations went down the drain. I realized that we were no longer on the verge of exponential acceleration, but it was happening. Falling upwards on the slope, like gravity had inversed. As an artist, how do I compete? As an entrepreneur, how do I succeed? How do I avoid obsoletion as a creator? 

My immediate instinct was to reject it, but I knew the only path forward was to fully embrace it. And after a few months of incorporating Stable Diffusion and DALLE into my workflow, I realized that it's not AI, it's just a glimpse into the future of data compression and intelligently guided interpolation. 

So I almost feel stupid for reacting the way I did. Not that I think my feelings were invalid, but I (like many others) looked into it a bit too deeply. In the end, it's all just compression and interpolation.

*"it's all just compression mate"*

I advocate for leaning into "AI"
We're entering the most introspective period in our collective history.
It will be a time to reorganize, and reassemble to best collaborate with "AI". 
It will enable for more complex systems, and more opportunities for self-organization. 

That is a beautiful thing that I"m excited to see unfold.
